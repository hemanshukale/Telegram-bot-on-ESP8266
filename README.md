# Telegram-bot-on-ESP8266
Minimalist code for Telegram echo bot on ESP8266; no extra libraries required  

Here's a code for constant communication between your phone/desktop and ESP over the internet  
Telegram messenger gives us an option of creating headless bots; so you can easily program your laptop/pi/esp to do something when a corresponding string is recieved, or to notify you of any event that can be detected by the ESP 

To create a bot, search BotFather on telegram and simply follow the instructions..  
a token is provided which is unique identity for your bot, you need to enter this token in your code for proper working  

And you just need a working Wi-Fi connection..

This is just a code for echo bot; but once you have the strings , you can play with them however you want...  

Enjoy :)
